Phrasing

To help in rapid writing, shorthand words may often be joined. This is
known as phrasing. Outlines should only be phrased when they join easily
and naturally, the meaning being clear, as shown in the examples in this
book. The first word in a phrase is written in its normal position:

5 pe cent, 20 per cent per annum.

No fe: The sign for per cent must always be used with a figure, as shown,
B â€˜not with a shorthand outline.
Asma light, slanting tick at the end of a word represents the. The tick

oe ae se
is the, todothe, isto.
