Bharath Silk Show Room, Chennai.
Sirs, -- We-have-the invoice for-the forty bales of sarees today, and-as-the lorry carrying-them is due to arrive on-Wednesday-the 10th, we-shall hope to-receive-them at a time to-suit our purpose. We-think-the new sarees are likely to-catch. Our customers
emphasize-the necessity of changing-the designs of-these sarees. They say it amuses-the buyers and-entices them to buy. The business of-selling-these sarees in-this season is lovely. Yours, Moris.










Messrs. Joseph Smith,
Sirs, We-wish to put forth, our heavy-losses of earlier six months were due to-such causes as-the failure of M/s. Gothi Sons, Pune; the unnecessarily heavy charges on-our agencies at Bangalore and the unsuccessful scheme of bonus to customers. As of-the remedy, we-can only counsel-the exercise of patience at-this-time. He thinks-the new season may-be successful, and he hopes to see heavy sales. We hope to satisfy all-those-who possess-the shares of-the firm. Yours sincerely,
