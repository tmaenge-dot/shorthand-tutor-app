NOTES FOR INSTRUCTORS:

1. TIMING FLEXIBILITY: The 2-hour lesson can be divided into two 1-hour sessions if needed to accommodate institutional scheduling.

2. DIFFERENTIATED LEARNING: Provide additional support for learners who struggle with fine motor skills and extended practice for advanced learners.

3. ASSESSMENT INTEGRATION: Each lesson builds toward the theory checks outlined in the scheme of work. Regular formative assessment helps identify learners needing additional support.

4. HOMEWORK EXPECTATIONS: Daily practice is essential for muscle memory development. Assign 15-20 minutes of practice per day.

5. RESOURCES: Ensure adequate supply of shorthand practice paper with proper line spacing for stroke formation.

6. PROGRESSION TRACKING: Monitor each learner's progress and adjust pace as needed while maintaining class cohesion.

7. TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION: Consider using digital tools for demonstration where available, but maintain focus on handwritten practice.

This lesson plan format follows the institutional requirements and provides comprehensive coverage of the first three modules of the shorthand syllabus.
