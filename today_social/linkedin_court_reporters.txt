ðŸŽ¯ Court Reporting Professionals: Are your students struggling with speed requirements?

I've been working on something that could help. After talking with court reporting instructors across the country, I kept hearing the same challenges:

â€¢ Students dropping out due to speed barriers
â€¢ Limited practice time outside class hours  
â€¢ Inconsistent feedback on technique
â€¢ High costs for supplementary materials

So we built a comprehensive, interactive Pitman Shorthand platform that addresses these issues directly:

âœ… Progressive speed development (80-120+ WPM)
âœ… 24/7 practice access for students
âœ… Real-time feedback on stroke accuracy
âœ… Detailed analytics for instructors
âœ… Complete NCS syllabus alignment
âœ… Completely free for schools and students

Early partner schools are seeing improved retention rates and faster skill development.

If you're involved in court reporting education, I'd love to get your feedback: https://tmaenge-dot.github.io/shorthand-tutor-app/
