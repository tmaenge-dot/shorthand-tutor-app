Dear Sir/Madam,

RE: INDUSTRIAL ATTACHMENT – SECRETARIAL STUDENTS

Zwenshambe Brigades Centre provides tuition in the one-year National
Certificate in Secretarial Studies (NCS) that is examined and certificated
by the Botswana Institute of Administration and Commerce (BIAC).  Our
current batch of students will write their final examinations in April this
year.

It is a requirement of the Examining Board that students undertake and pass
an Industrial Attachment for a period of three (3) months before they can
be certificated.  Work experience of this kind is very worthwhile as it
enables the students to put into practice the skills and knowledge they
have acquired in the classroom.

We are therefore requesting your organization to attach one student for the
period Monday 19th April, 2004 to Friday 9th July 2004.

The student’s performance should be monitored by a supervisor who will be
required to complete a log sheet of all activities undertaken during the
attachment.  Please note that your organization is not obligated to provide
our student with any financial reward during the period of attachment.

Your support in our request will be highly appreciated.

Yours truly,

Supervisors are requested to expose students to at least two skill areas in
each Section during the Attachment period.

The mark allocations for the three Sections are as follows:

1.0 Computer Skills          -    20 marks
2.0 Accounting Skills        -    40 marks
3.0 Commerce                 -    20 marks
       Total Mark (Logbook)  80 marks

Supervisors should apply their judgement to allocate the marks within each
Section.

As an example, suppose your Organization exposes the student to two parts
of Section 1 (Computer Skills), namely “create and format spreadsheets” and
“create and format presentation slides”.

The Supervisor will assess (mark) the student’s skills at “create and
format spreadsheets” out of 10 marks and assess “create and format
presentation slides” out of 10 marks, to derive the 20 marks for that
Section.

If your Organization exposes the student to 5 parts of Section 2
(Secretarial Skills), each part will be assessed out of 8 marks to derive
the 40 marks for that Section.

The Core Skills Component seeks to assess the student’s personal and
interpersonal skills demonstrated during the Attachment.  This assessment
carries a maximum of 20 marks.


The mark for the Practical Training Component should be added to the mark
for the Core Skills Component to derive the Total Attachment Mark.
