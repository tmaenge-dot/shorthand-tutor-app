  - Theory points and phonetic explanations
  - Common mistakes and solutions
  - Study tips and memory aids
  - Expandable sections for different stroke types

### Authentication NCS Stroke Definitions

Based on extracted content from the official NCS reference book:

#### Unit 1: Straight Downstrokes
- **Theory**: "The first six consonants are represented by light or darker straight strokes written downwards"
- **Pairs**: P/B (downward), T/D (upward), CH/J (slanted upward)
- **Rule**: "Light sound is represented by a light stroke, and a corresponding darker sound is represented by a darker stroke"

#### Unit 2: Curved Strokes  
- **Theory**: Fricatives use curved formations
- **Examples**: F/V (curved), TH light/heavy (steep curved), S (circle), SH (shallow curve)
- **Rule**: Same formation pattern, weight distinguishes voicing

#### Unit 3: Horizontal Strokes
- **Theory**: Velars (K/G) and nasals (M/N/NG) use horizontal formations
- **Direction**: Always written left to right
- **Rule**: Weight still distinguishes voicing where applicable

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

```javascript
// Stroke visualization data
const strokeVisualizationData = {
  unit_1_straight_downstrokes: {
    title: 'Straight Downstrokes - First Six Consonants',
    strokes: [
      {
        consonant: 'P',
        formation: 'Light straight downstroke',
        direction: 'downward',
        weight: 'light',
        svg_path: 'M 50 20 L 50 80',
        examples: ['pay', 'tape', 'cup'],
        pairs_with: 'B'
      }
      // ... more strokes
    ]
  }
}
```

### Assessment Question Types

1. **stroke_identification**: Identify consonant by stroke description
2. **direction_practice**: Test knowledge of stroke direction
3. **weight_distinction**: Test understanding of light vs heavy
4. **pairing_practice**: Test knowledge of consonant pairs
5. **formation_understanding**: Test comprehension of systematic rules

### Navigation Integration

Added to main navigation menu:
- `/stroke-recognition` - Visual learning system
- `/stroke-assessment` - Assessment and testing
- Dashboard quick actions include stroke learning links

## Learning Progression

### Unit 1: Foundation Strokes
- P/B (downward strokes)
- T/D (upward strokes) 
- CH/J (slanted upward strokes)
- **Focus**: Direction and weight distinction

### Unit 2: Curved Formations
- F/V (curved strokes)
- TH light/heavy (steep curved)
- S (circle), SH (shallow curve)
- **Focus**: Curve types and fricative patterns

### Unit 3: Horizontal Patterns
- K/G (velar horizontals)
- M/N/NG (nasal horizontals)
- L (upward stroke)
- **Focus**: Horizontal direction consistency

## Key Features
