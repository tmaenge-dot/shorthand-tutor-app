- Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Configure analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)

### 3. Deploy to Hosting Platform

#### Option A: Netlify (Recommended for React apps)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

#### Option B: Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel
