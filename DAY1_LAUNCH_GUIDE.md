**Subject: Help Test My New Shorthand Learning App - Free Access!**

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I've just finished developing something I'm really excited about, and I'd love your help.

**What I've Built:**
I've created an interactive Shorthand Tutor app that teaches Pitman shorthand using modern technology. It's like having a personal shorthand instructor available 24/7, complete with speed development exercises, practice sessions, and progress tracking.

**Why I Need Your Help:**
Before launching publicly, I want to make sure this app actually helps people learn shorthand effectively. I'm looking for a small group of dedicated testers to use the app and give me honest feedback.

**What's In It For You:**
✅ Completely free access to the full app
✅ Learn a valuable professional skill (shorthand)
✅ Direct influence on the final product
✅ Early access to innovative educational technology

**Time Commitment:**
- Just 20-30 minutes a day for 3 weeks
- One quick feedback session per week
- Use it whenever convenient for you

**Get Started Right Now:**
Simply visit: **http://localhost:3003/**
Create an account and start exploring! The app includes a built-in tutorial and feedback system.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Any device with internet (computer, tablet, phone)
- No downloads needed - works in your browser

**Questions?**
Just reply to this email! I'm here to help with setup or answer anything about shorthand learning.

**Ready to help me make shorthand education better?**
Visit http://localhost:3003/ and dive in! I'll check in with you next week to see how it's going.

Thanks for considering this - your feedback could help thousands of future learners!

Best,
[Your Name]
