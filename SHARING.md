# Sharing the Shorthand Tutor App with Your Learners

## Quick Share for Tomorrow's Class

### Option 1: Local Network Sharing (Recommended for Classroom)

1. **Stop the current server** (if running) with `Ctrl+C`

2. **Start the network-accessible server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:network
   ```

3. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   - **On Linux:** `ip addr show | grep inet`
   - **On Windows:** `ipconfig`
   - **On Mac:** `ifconfig | grep inet`
   
   Look for something like `192.168.1.XXX` or `10.0.0.XXX`

4. **Share with learners:**
   - Give them your IP address and port: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3001`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3001`

5. **Learners connect:**
   - Same WiFi network required
   - Open browser and go to the provided address

### Option 2: Production Build for Stable Sharing

1. **Build and preview:**
   ```bash
   npm run share
   ```

2. **Share the address:**
   - Usually `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:4173`
   - More stable for longer sessions

## Network Requirements

- **All devices must be on the same WiFi network**
- **Firewall:** May need to allow port 3001 and 4173
- **Router:** Should allow device-to-device communication

## Troubleshooting

### If learners can't connect:

1. **Check firewall settings:**
   ```bash
   # On Ubuntu/Linux:
   sudo ufw allow 3001
   sudo ufw allow 4173
   ```

2. **Verify IP address is correct**

3. **Try different port:**
   - Edit vite.config.js and change port number
   - Restart server

4. **Test connection:**
   - Try accessing from another device first
   - Check if both devices are on same network

## Alternative: Simple File Sharing

If network sharing doesn't work:

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Share the `dist` folder:**
   - Copy to USB drive
   - Share via cloud storage
   - Learners can open `dist/index.html` in browser
