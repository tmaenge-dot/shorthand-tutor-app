SUBJECT: Reduce Student Dropout Rates - Free Interactive Shorthand Learning Platform

Dear Admissions Coordinator,

I hope you're having a great day. I'm writing from Tswapong Bokone Brigade about a resource that could significantly improve student retention in your court reporting program.

We understand that court reporting programs face challenges with student dropout rates, particularly when students struggle to meet speed requirements. We've developed a solution that directly addresses this issue.

**STUDENT RETENTION CHALLENGES WE SOLVE:**
â€¢ Students struggling to reach 80-120+ WPM requirements
â€¢ Limited practice time outside of classroom hours
â€¢ Inconsistent feedback leading to technique problems
â€¢ Student frustration and program abandonment
â€¢ Additional costs for supplementary materials

**OUR RETENTION IMPROVEMENT SOLUTION:**
âœ… Progressive speed building from basic to 120+ WPM
âœ… 24/7 practice access reducing student frustration
âœ… Real-time feedback preventing bad technique habits
âœ… Detailed progress tracking for early intervention
âœ… Mobile access for practice during commutes/breaks
âœ… Completely free - no additional student costs

**RETENTION BENEFITS FOR BRYAN UNIVERSITY:**
ðŸŽ¯ Higher program completion rates
ðŸŽ¯ Improved student satisfaction scores
ðŸŽ¯ Earlier identification of struggling students
ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced reputation for student success
ðŸŽ¯ Reduced need for remedial instruction time

Bryan University's commitment to student success aligns perfectly with our platform's mission. I'd be honored to discuss how this could enhance your program's already strong foundation.

**PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:**
â€¢ Integration with your existing curriculum
â€¢ Faculty training and support
â€¢ Student progress analytics for advisors
â€¢ Custom branding for your institution

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a brief call to explore how this could benefit your students and program metrics?

Best regards,

P.S. We're seeing 15-20% improvement in speed development timelines with early partner institutions. I'd love to share these results with you.
