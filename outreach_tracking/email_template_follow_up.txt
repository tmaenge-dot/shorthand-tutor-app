Dear [CONTACT_NAME],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on my message from last week regarding our interactive Pitman Shorthand learning platform.

I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. The platform I mentioned has been specifically designed to address the challenges that [COURT REPORTING STUDENTS/BUSINESS STUDENTS/PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS] face with shorthand skill development.

**Quick Reminder of Key Benefits:**
â€¢ Completely free access - no costs to your [PROGRAM/ORGANIZATION]
â€¢ Immediate implementation - no technical setup required
â€¢ Enhanced [STUDENT SUCCESS/MEMBER VALUE] through interactive learning
â€¢ Detailed analytics for [ACADEMIC ASSESSMENT/MEMBER ENGAGEMENT]

**Next Steps (Choose What Works for You):**
1. ðŸ“§ Reply with any questions about the platform
2. ðŸ“ž Schedule a brief 10-minute call for quick overview
3. ðŸ’» Try the demo yourself: https://tmaenge-dot.github.io/shorthand-tutor-app/
4. ðŸ“… Request a formal presentation for your team

No pressure at all - I simply believe this resource could provide real value to your [STUDENTS/MEMBERS], and I'd hate for you to miss the opportunity to explore it.
