Fellow court reporting educators and professionals! 👋

I wanted to share something I've been working on that might interest this community. After conversations with instructors and students, I've developed an interactive Pitman Shorthand learning platform.

**Why I built this:**
• Too many talented students dropping out due to speed challenges
• Limited practice opportunities outside classroom hours
• Need for consistent, immediate feedback on technique
• High costs of supplementary learning materials

**What it offers:**
✅ Progressive speed development exercises (80-120+ WPM)
✅ 24/7 practice access on any device
✅ Real-time feedback on stroke accuracy and technique
✅ Detailed progress tracking for instructors
✅ Complete NCS syllabus alignment
✅ Completely free for students and institutions

**Early results from partner schools:**
• 15-20% faster speed development
• Improved student confidence and engagement
• Better retention rates in programs
• Enhanced instructor insights into student progress

The platform is live at: https://tmaenge-dot.github.io/shorthand-tutor-app/

I'd really value feedback from this professional community. What are the biggest challenges you see in shorthand education today? How do you think technology can best support traditional stenography instruction?

Looking forward to your thoughts! 📝⚡
